# Stereo-Install
I installed a new head unit for my moms friends son. Just a Boss head unit with a reverse camera and Carplay. The hardest part was rewiring the speakers and other assorted wires because its a 2002 highlander with nothing labeled. I just cut the harness and started splicing and eventually got it to work. The weirdest thing is that there were 7 speakers and 7 inputs with 1 output so I guess all of the negatives went into the signal ground and it works. Still hear some static coming from the speakers whenever they're on so maybe ill suggest installing a new amp but not sure if its worth it. There was also a wire called beep but I had no clue how to hook it up and I'm pretty sure it controls the volume of the volume control but not sure.
